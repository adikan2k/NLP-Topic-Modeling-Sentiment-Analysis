It really resonates with me this one. As a dad that’s age with a son a little bit older we’ve not seen eye to eye in ten years. ( nothing bad just teenage coming age stuff and me also getting into my fifties). As he’s got older the last few weeks I see him as 24 year old man rather than the toddler he was or the petulant teenager messing up his exams.

There’s a strong men’s emotional health thread running through this. Men are often raised to 'hold it together', 'be strong', 'say less'. The skill and the compassion is in noticing. That’s what this advert captured for me. Don't get me wrong, I was also taken back to the '90's - my gosh it hit a nerve and I downloaded 'the record' ⁠immediately :D but what I loved was the point about recognition, empathy, and the quiet bravery of care.

"Hopefully you actually know why Christmas is called Christmas? Or have you forgotten? The clue is in the first 6 letters... It actually means ""the one who has been anointed"" There is a message right there, and a big one. Most of all at Christmas we thank God for the word being made flesh through the Holy Spirit - a novel idea first potentially available from the time of first creation (when All Three were already present then)... You use three words ""fun"", ""happy"" and ""joy"" FUN originally meant to cheat or hoax or make a fool of somebody, so a worthless and deceiving/distracting word, as we I think know in our hearts HAPPY means to have a chance, to have some luck - so better, but nothing blessed or divine, just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes. JOY relates to being glad and rejoicing, but ""enjoy"" suggests more of it - but the birth of Jesus is as much joy as we will ever need, and joy is a divine gift founded in love and truth that can be experienced even in the face of sadness and difficulty, because Father, Son and Holy Spirit offer us resilience against bad worldly things. The word you missed - a great word - is ""merry"". Not by chance do we say ""Merry Christmas"" and ""make merry"". When the Prodigal Son returned, the Father ordered all to make merry... With merry we make an effort to find joy, even if the circumstances do not encourage that - while that might involve more or less alcohol (""he became slightly merry""), it mainly involves spirit, effort, FORGIVENESS, togetherness - as in the film above. The greatest gift of the Holy Trinity is mercy and forgiveness, and if we can ""GET OVER IT"" then we are doing God's work here on Earth, here in the awful 1 John 5:19 world. Try this: (I am far from being a Mormon, but, through the Holy Spirit, I look for joy and beauty wherever it is to be found) - this shows the spirit of Christmas better than I ever can.",0.2998511904761906,0.4767261904761904,positive,positive,0.48862555623054504,0.48862555623054504,0.04520033299922943,0.46617406606674194,positive,0.3942383733533678

"John Lewis, you've absolutely smashed it for me this year. I’m 46, and lately I’ve been looking back a lot… my younger self, my rave days, the freedom, the late nights. I miss it more than I expected. These last few years have been rough. My mental health took a dip and it affected my kids. My youngest and I have had the hardest time. My career took over much of my parenting and I missed more than I want to admit. But life has a way of giving us a second chance. This past year he’s had his own struggles, and somehow that opened a space for both of us to heal. He’s helped me. I’ve helped him. We’ve met each other again. And the funny thing is — we found our way back through music. House music. The beats of my younger days. We share songs, talk about memories, dance in the kitchen, gone to gigs Different generations, same rhythm. To me, that’s what parenting — and Christmas — is about. Not being perfect. Not getting it all right the first time. But finding a way to reconnect, laugh again, and love each other in real, everyday ways. Here’s to second chances. To softer hearts. To music that carries us home. 💛",0.0895238095238095,0.3886904761904762,neutral,positive,0.8743073344230652,0.8743073344230652,0.03721100091934204,0.08848170191049576,positive,0.4819155719734374
